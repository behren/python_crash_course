Personal repository that keeps track of my learning process of Eric Matthes' `Python Crash Course (2nd Ed.)`.

I highly recommend this book to everyone trying to get into `Python`. It is available at [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e).

A collection of resources for the book is available [here](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/).
